summary: Over the past few weeks I've not been able to do a whole lot of running.  I had a little bit of an injury, and decided to take time off.  I'm beginning to feel quite a bit better as I knew I would, and I can finally begin some easy runs to get in the swing of things again.  During my time off, I began to think to myself about what it would be like if I wasn't sure if I could continue running, and what type of effect it might have on me.  Then I discovered the story of Kayla Montgomery.

She is an inspiration to many people out there, especially runners.  She was diagnosed with [Multiple Sclerosis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_sclerosis) when she was 14 years old.  The disease isn't a pretty one, and unfortunately has no cure.  She decided to take up running when she was in the 9th grade, and she took it from there.  Below is a video about her, and her high school coach who always catches her at the finish line.

I thought the video was incredible.  She wanted to run, and she wanted her coach to push her to her fullest potential.  Her coach said that her freshman year she was possibly "Varsity Hopeful" by her senior year.  The thing is she kept running and giving it her all knowing that she may be unable to run the next year.  Eventually she made the girls varsity team, and then she was the fastest girl.  Before she knew it, Kayla was training with the boys full time.  By Kayla's senior year, she was a top runner in her home state of North Carolina.  I think this shows incredible progress, especially a person with her condition!  Most high school runners would love to become a state champion, much less an all-state contender, but few actually do.  Running with the intent of improving requires a whole lot of heart and dedication to do so, to be honest just running for enjoyment takes a lot of dedication.  The story of Kayla Montgomery shows that she gives it her all, every single day.  All of us should take something from the example she set.  Treat each day as a gift and love every minute you are able to get out and run.  

From what I am able to gather Kayla is currently a collegiate runner attending [Lipscomb University](http://www.lipscomb.edu) in Nashville, TN and is an asset to her girls cross country team.  It is a pretty strong program at Lipscomb and yes, it is a NCAA Division I school.  I really wish her the absoulte best of luck and hope she is able to continue running for years to come!

The next time you are sitting on the couch trying to find motivation to run, remember Kayla, and you should be itching to get out the door.
