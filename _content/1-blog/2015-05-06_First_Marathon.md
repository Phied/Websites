summary:  Finishing a marathon is an item that many people have on their bucket list.  It doesn't matter if a person runs it, walks it, or does a combination of the two.  In the end, it's a whole lot of time on your feet, and in my case, it was an excruciating experience.

### The Day Before
On the drive down to Todd, NC for the [New River Marathon](http://www.newrivermarathon.com) I had quite a bit of pondering about what I was going to be doing the next day.  My training buildup was what I would call minimalistic - at best.  The combination of horrible running weather this winter and into early spring, coupled with last minute marathon searching, didn't allow me to have huge expectations for myself.  My longest run up to this point was 16 miles, and my average weekly miles leading up to the event was about 35 miles.  

Having the combination of running hills at home, and feeling as strong as I did on my 16 miler 6 days before, I figured I could maybe run the same pace for the marathon as my 16 miler since it wasn't super difficult.  Since I ran the 16 miler at home at an average pace of 8:15, I figured that a super best-case scenario would be a 3:30:00.  I also knew that I rarely had a best-case scenario race and that my adrenaline and likely [Hampton Runner](http://hamptonrunner.com/about/) would make it difficult to stay slow and relaxed in the beginning.  Having never experienced a marathon before, and basing everything on stories and other people's experiences, I figured I'd hit the wall.  At the end of all of my mental rambling, I figured I should run anywhere from a 3:45 to 4:00.

### The 26.2 Mile Adventure!
The alarm went off at 5:45, although I didn't really need it to go off.  I got all of my stuff ready and we ([Hampton Runner](http://hamptonrunner.com/about/) and I) headed out the door.  He was needing some coffee as part of his pre-race ritual.  So on the way to the race, we looked for an open gas station.  Let me tell you, apparently in this area, they sleep in on Saturday, luckily, we found a McDonalds.  He got his coffee, and I got my *ever-nutritious sausage, egg, and cheese McGridle* - yummy!  We arrived on location with plenty of time to spare.  We were glad we took my all-wheel drive vehicle due to the tall grass and un-even ground parking.  

After stretching, and having horrible nerves, the race was on!  The gun went off 15 minutes late, and we began trotting.  Mile one was wonderful.  I was relaxed, felt good all over, and knew I was getting my 3:45 at least.  Bring on mile 2!  Well, I assure you, it brought it from here on out.  After going up the first smaller hill in mile 2, my extreme outer calves (peroneal tendons) became extremely tight - to the point of quite painful.  At the beginning of mile 3, I told my running partner to head on ahead without me.  There was no way I was hitting close to his goal of 3:24:59 today.  He said he wasn't hitting it today either, and that he'd hang with me.  I felt bad, he looked very strong to me, and I knew the goal time was quite important to him.  After refusing to leave me behind, we continued right along and my legs continued to hate me through mile 4, which was pretty much slightly downhill the whole way.  I was afraid for my legs for mile 5.

Mile 5 was already here, and there's a monster here.  The monster is a couple hundred feet high and nearly a mile long.  This thing is intimidating for people in shape, and for a person with lower extremities already unhappy, it is a giant spirit-breaker.  We ran up this thing a bit.  My legs burned, and of course my lungs did as well - sort of.  We decided to walk/shuffle up the remaining 60% of the hill.  Mile 6 was a welcome mile for sure - all down hill.  

At mile 7, my legs began to loosen up (FINALLY!) By mile 8, I was virtually pain free, and we were back in business.  We began to gain on runners, and pass a few while chatting and remaining overall loose.  Mile 8 came and went, and by mile 9, something was off.

I started to get a little nagging pain in my right foot.  I knew this race is intimidating, and that I would most likely get some form of a nagging pain off and on.  Just one of those weird things that happens.  It will go away soon I reassured myself.  Just keep on going at an easy pace.  We continued to gain on more runners.

Mile 10 was where I started to worry.  The pain was getting a bit intense, but my stride wasn't out of whack yet.  I still felt in control, a little bit.  I started complaining a bit though, trying to readjust things.  Whatever this was, it wasn't going away.  It was to the point that if it was a training run, I'd have dropped a long time ago.  My breathing was fine, my legs felt fresh at this point, but my foot decided it was to early to be out running, and it was getting payback on me.

I barely made it through mile 11, and was limping a little bit at this point.  Then mile 12 started.  I came to a halt.  I felt like a nail was being driven through my near heel area and there was no motion I could make to stop it.  We decided to hobble and walk from here until it subsided.  Eventually we made it to 13.1 - the halfway point.  It was horribly depressing and painful.  Somehow, we made it here under 2 hours with a decent amount of walking.  That was an upside I suppose.  At mile 14 so many runners had past us that one of the emergency personnel had been told about me and came to pick me up.  I was nearly in tears from this foot - even when walking.  We told the emergency responder that I was going to keep going if at all possible.  At points I had to stop for 20 seconds to gather my thoughts while my walking partner at this point would say "We're going to hit the finish line no matter what" and other things like [#suckitupbuttercup](http://www.twitter.com/#suckitupbuttercup).  

The miles crawled by, and one man at a water stop gave me some ibuprofen.  Eventually, a few miles later, my pain subsided.  The ibuprofen helped.  That man that had the Ibuprofen for me has to have a name that starts with "Saint".  If he doesn't, I'm founding a new religion in his name.  It helped me that much.  I started walking more normally, and by mile 20 we started short bursts of trotting again.

We looked at our overall time, and saw that if I was able to jog enough, we might be able to break 5 hours.  We slowly took our mile times from over 18 minutes, to 17, and then to 16 minutes.  Before we knew it, we had run our slowest mile at 24 in nearly 12 minutes.  Mile 25 was done in under 9 minutes!  Good God, it hurt, but I was determined to get under 5 hours.  Due to the odd landing I had to do to keep from collapsing at every step, my calves were getting worn out and they began to cramp up - hard.  I had 10 minutes left and a little over half of a mile left in the race.  I really didn't think I'd get it in at this point with my calves cramping so hard and my foot still not wanting to let up.  Then some force from above sent me a guy that was barely moving in front of me.  The only thing that kept me going was my crazy competitive nature.  I had to pass that guy - or die.  

We passed that poor guy, and had .2 miles left when my running partner decides to sprint.  When I mean sprint, I mean I saw dust flying up, plants come uprooted, and flames ignite on the ground.   I even heard BEEP BEEP!  I half expected a coyote with an ACME rocket to make an appearance.  I didn't even look at my watch, I just wanted to finish.  

My last foot landed, and the timer showed 4:57:58.  Somehow, I had finished.  Unfortunately, I never got to experience the wall or the other things marathoners face in the realm of normal.  I did realize though that my next marathon, assuming I can heal up from this one will be a pretty impressive PR.  Should be in the realm of 1 hour anyways.  

If anyone ever experiences the pain I felt, I am so sorry.  If you are in the same situation as me, I'm sure that you will have more sense than me and take the easy way out!  Now I get to look forward to recovery from a race that didn't make me breath all that hard, but had me hurt more than any other time in my life.  My next marathon will be crushed!
